# ML_Libraries

A from-scratch implementation of core Machine Learning algorithms in Python, built to understand the mathematical and algorithmic foundations without using high-level ML libraries.

# Overview

- Implements classical ML algorithms from scratch
- Focuses on algorithm internals, not black-box usage
- Modular, readable, and educational codebase
- Includes visualizations for better interpretability

# Algorithms Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means Clustering
- Decision Trees
- N-Layer Neural Network

# Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

# Learning Outcomes

- Mathematical intuition behind ML algorithms
- Gradient descent & optimization
- Model evaluation and bias-variance tradeoffs
